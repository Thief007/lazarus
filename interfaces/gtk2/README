The gtk2 interface for lazarus
==============================

The gtk2 interface for lazarus is a descendant of the gtk interface. It is not
yet complete. For those who want to help us here are some hints:

1. The gtk2 interface needs the gtk2 bindings 'gtk2forpascal' from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk2forpascal/.
Please download the latest cvs in a directory of your choice. It contains the
package gtk2forlazarus.lpk. For example:

 []$ export CVS_RSH=ssh
 []$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gtk2forpascal.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gtk2forpascal
 []$ cvs login
 []$ cvs -z3 co gtk2


2. Open the package gtk2forlazarus.lpk.
The package contains all the needed search paths and compiler options to
compile a 'gtk2 application' in lazarus. A gtk2 application is a program, that
uses the gtk2 libs. Don't confuse this with a 'LCL application using the gtk2
interface'.

3. Open the package <lazarusdir>/lcl/interfaces/gtk2/gtk2interface.lpk.
This package contains all the needed compiler options to compile the gtk2
interface for the LCL.

4. Create a new lazarus application. This project will be used to test the gtk2
interface and to store all configuration steps. Open the project inspector and
add 'GTK2Interface' as required package to the project.
Then open the compiler options and set as widget type 'gtk2'.

When you compile your program, the IDE will automatically compile the
bindings and the gtk2 interface.

When you save the project, the IDE will remember the above steps, so you have
to the above steps only once.
