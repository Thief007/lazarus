1. LCL

  Graphics
    State: loading bmp and xpm works for 16/24 depth
           Palettes basically implemented in gtk-interface
    Skills: knowledge of LCL, VCL, deep knowledge of interfaces
    Difficulty: high

  Docking (= the combination of forms)
    State: started. The DockManager/DockTree is missing
    Skills: deep knowledge of LCL, VCL and probably also the interfaces
    Difficulty: high
  
  Frames (= forms as childs)
    State: not implemented
    Skills: deep knowledge of LCL, VCL, interfaces and IDE
    Difficulty: high

  TControl.Font
    State: not implemented. In contrary to the VCL the LCL should use the
           current Theme of the user. So, the Font property should only work,
           if explicitly set
           Works in winapi, and a few places in gtk
    Skills: knowledge of LCL, gtk, win32
    Difficulty: medium
