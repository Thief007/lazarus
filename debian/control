Description: Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool for Free Pascal
 Lazarus are the class libraries for Free Pascal that emulate Delphi.
 Free Pascal is a GPL'd compiler that runs on Linux, Win32, OS/2, 68K
 and other OS's. Free Pascal is designed to be able to understand and
 compile programs written with the Delphi syntax, which is object-oriented.
 Lazarus is the part of the missing puzzle that will allow you to develop
 Delphi-like programs in all of the above platforms.
 .
 Unlike Java's "write once, run anywhere" motto, Lazarus and Free Pascal
 strive for "write once, compile anywhere". Since the exact same compiler
 is available on all of the above platforms you don't need to do any recoding
 to produce identical products for different platforms.
 .
 In short, Lazarus is a free RAD tool for Free Pascal using its Lazarus 
 Component Library (LCL).
 .
 This IDE will eventually reach Delphi's full functionality.
