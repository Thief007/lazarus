  Revision 1.6  1999/07/09 13:54:41  lazarus
  Changed to use Dispatch instead of DispatchStr for messaging.
  You pass it LM_Message which is an integer value and therefore you
  can now use Dispatch to send the integer value back to the class.
  There is currently a problem with having multiple "message" procedures
  in one class so I commented them out for now.
