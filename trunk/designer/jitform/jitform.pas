  Abstract:
    TJITForm - just-in-time form.
    
    This TForm descendent is used by the IDE as a template for creating forms
    at run time (the designed forms).
    Because the IDE does wild things with this form, like creating an own class
    for each TJITForm and dynamically creating methods for it, you can't use
    some special compiling modes like -pg (gprof) with it.
    Therefore this unit is kept in a directory of its own.
