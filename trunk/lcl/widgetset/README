This directory contains all sceleton widgetset component 
classes. These classes will never get instantiated and may 
only contain class functions.

IMPORTANT

Derivation and inheritance of classes is different then one
might be used to. It wil be explained by the following 
example.

Suppose the following LCL class hierarchy:

 TLCLComponent
     |
     v     
  TControl
     |
     v     
 TWinControl
 
the corresponding WS skeleton would be

 TWSLCLComponent
      |
      v     
  TWSControl
      |
      v     
 TWSWinControl


When method X of TWSControl gets implemented by 
widgetset Q the hierarchy looks like


 TWSLCLComponent
      |
      v     
  TWSControl --> TQWSControl.X
      |
      v     
 TWSWinControl


When the same method X is required in TWSWinControl
inheritance doesnt work since TWSWinControl.X calls
TWSControl.X
The following can be done to get around this:
*) try to move the LCL functionality to the lowest 
   class
*) Implement TQWSWinControl.X by simply calling
   TQWSControl.X
*) Implement the functionality of TQWSControl.X
   in the TQWidgetSet and call it from both    
   TQWSControl.X and TQWSWinControl.X
