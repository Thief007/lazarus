This directory contains all images needed by the LCL.
Images are stored in lazarus resource files (.lrs). Each icon is stored
in xpm format.

How to update the image resources:

Creating a lazarus resource can easily be done by the lazres program.
If you have not yet compiled lazres, go to the tools directory and type make.

cd <lazarusdir>/lcl/images/
../../tools/lazres ../lclicons.lrs *.xpm
