Installation hints for lazarus
==============================

Lazarus provides two main parts:
- LCL - the Lazarus Component Library
- IDE - the RAD tool

What is required for lazarus:
- FreePascal - the FreePascal Compiler plus packages plus sources.
- gtk - Most distributions already install them. See www.gtk.org.


The FAQ - Frequently Asked Question is available at www.lazarus.freepascal.org.


The following will describe how to get FreePascal and how to install lazarus
properly:


1. Installing FreePascal

1.1 Installing FreePascal under Linux:
  Lazarus requires a fpc (FreePascal) version not older than 21th september 2002
  and it requires both - the fpc libs and the fpc sources.
  At the lazarus downloads section you can get the rpm of the freepascal
  compiler and its packages without the sources. Or if you don't
  have a rpm system, you can download and install the tars.
  
  ToDo: How to get the FreePascal Sources

  You can get the freepascal sources via cvs. Create a directory, where you
  would like to put the sources. You don't need to be root to do this. Any
  normal user can do:
  
  []$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:cvs@cvs.freepascal.org:/FPC/CVS
  []$ cvs login

  password is 'cvs' without the ''

  []$ cvs -z3 co -r FIXES_1_0_0 fpc

2. Installing Lazarus

2.1 Installing Lazarus under Linux:
  Currently there are no rpms for lazarus, but hopefully there will be rpms and
  debs in a few weeks. Because the whole lazarus stuff is installed into one
  directory, uninstall is very easy and you don't need to be root to install
  lazarus.
  You can get tars from the downloads section or you can download it directly
  via cvs.
  
  ToDo: more details about the tars.
  
  You can download lazarus by cvs. cvs provides an easy way to update your
  sources by just downloading the changes. This is the recommended way and saves
  you a lot of time. A connection to the internet is needed for this:
  You don't to be root. Lazarus does not need any special permissions, not
  during installation nor at runtime.
  First create a directory for lazarus (e.g. /home/username/freepascal) then do
  the following:
  
  connect to the cvs server (note: lazarus and freepascal use the same server)
  
  []$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:cvs@cvs.freepascal.org:/FPC/CVS
  []$ cvs login

  password is 'cvs' without the ''

  download the lazarus sources:

  []$ cvs -z3 co lazarus

  compile lazarus:

  []$ cd lazarus
  []$ make

  If fpc is installed correct, the compilation should work without problems. If
  not see FAQ.
  start lazarus

  []$ ./lazarus

  The IDE should start. In the terminal you can see some notes about missing
  settings. This is normal at first start.
  The IDE automatically tries to find out where the freepascal compiler and its
  sources are installed by searching in the most common directories.
  Check the paths:
    Use the IDE menu to go to
      Environment -> Environment Options -> Files

    The 'FPC Source directory' should point to your fpc source directory. This
    directory ends with /fpc/ (e.g. /usr/src/fpc) and contains directories
    like 'compiler', 'docs', 'fcl', 'rtl' and 'packages'.

    ToDo: explain the other paths
