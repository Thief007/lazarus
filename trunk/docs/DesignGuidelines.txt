This is for lazarus developers:

Coding style:
- Since one style is easier to read, Lazarus follows the Borland Coding style
  guide lines. Of course, almost anyone will find some points there, that are
  arguable less readable than other styles. That's ok, just try to follow at
  least 90%.
- Try to avoid unit circles. This makes it easier to navigate and when unit is
  growing allows to split it.
- Minimize the number of calls from Interfaces to LCL, when performing an
  action requested by the LCL.

New files:
- Every file should start with a header containing the license and a few lines
  describing the content.

Include files:
- should start with the {%MainUnit } directive

Packages:
- should have an .lpl entry in packager/globallinks/

Dialogs (modal forms):
- Close on Escape (if key not used otherwise)
- Define default button and Return activates it (if key not used)
- Medium to complex dialogs should be resizable and size is stored

Main Menu Items:
- Should have a key in keymapping.pp
