  Revision 1.50  2002/09/27 20:52:23  lazarus
  MWE: Applied patch from "Andrew Johnson" <aj_genius@hotmail.com>

  Here is the run down of what it includes -

   -Vasily Volchenko's Updated Russian Localizations

   -improvements to GTK Styles/SysColors
   -initial GTK Palette code - (untested, and for now useless)

   -Hint Windows and Modal dialogs now try to stay transient to
    the main program form, aka they stay on top of the main form
    and usually minimize/maximize with it.

   -fixes to Form BorderStyle code(tool windows needed a border)

   -fixes DrawFrameControl DFCS_BUTTONPUSH to match Win32 better
    when flat

   -fixes DrawFrameControl DFCS_BUTTONCHECK to match Win32 better
    and to match GTK theme better. It works most of the time now,
    but some themes, noteably Default, don't work.

   -fixes bug in Bitmap code which broke compiling in NoGDKPixbuf
    mode.

   -misc other cleanups/ fixes in gtk interface

   -speedbutton's should now draw correctly when flat in Win32

   -I have included an experimental new CheckBox(disabled by
    default) which has initial support for cbGrayed(Tri-State),
    and WordWrap, and misc other improvements. It is not done, it
    is mostly a quick hack to test DrawFrameControl
    DFCS_BUTTONCHECK, however it offers many improvements which
    can be seen in cbsCheck/cbsCrissCross (aka non-themed) state.

   -fixes Message Dialogs to more accurately determine
    button Spacing/Size, and Label Spacing/Size based on current
    System font.
   -fixes MessageDlgPos, & ShowMessagePos in Dialogs
   -adds InputQuery & InputBox to Dialogs

   -re-arranges & somewhat re-designs Control Tabbing, it now
    partially works - wrapping around doesn't work, and
    subcontrols(Panels & Children, etc) don't work. TabOrder now
    works to an extent. I am not sure what is wrong with my code,
    based on my other tests at least wrapping and TabOrder SHOULD
    work properly, but.. Anyone want to try and fix?

   -SynEdit(Code Editor) now changes mouse cursor to match
    position(aka over scrollbar/gutter vs over text edit)

   -adds a TRegion property to Graphics.pp, and Canvas. Once I
    figure out how to handle complex regions(aka polygons) data
    properly I will add Region functions to the canvas itself
    (SetClipRect, intersectClipRect etc.)

   -BitBtn now has a Stored flag on Glyph so it doesn't store to
    lfm/lrs if Glyph is Empty, or if Glyph is not bkCustom(aka
    bkOk, bkCancel, etc.) This should fix most crashes with older
    GDKPixbuf libs.
