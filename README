Welcome to Lazarus
==================

Lazarus is a Rapid Application Development Tool for FreePascal.
It comes with the LCL - Lazarus component library, which contains platform
independent visual components like buttons, windows, checkbox, treeview and
many, many more. The LCL is platform independent, so you can write an
application once and then compile for various platforms without changing code.

FreePascal at www.freepascal.org is a fast object pascal compiler (and more),
that runs on more than 20 platforms (linux, windows, BSD, OS/2, DOS, PowerPC,
and many more).

The LCL currently supports linux (gtk, gnome and little bit gtk2) and windows.
