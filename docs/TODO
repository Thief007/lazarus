1. LCL

  Graphics
    State: loading bmp and xpm works for 16/24 depth
           saving is not implemented, so streaming does not work
           Palettes basically implemented in gtk-interface
    Skills: knowledge of LCL, VCL, deep knowledge of interfaces
    Difficulty: high

  Docking (= the combination of forms)
    State: not implemented
    Skills: deep knowledge of LCL, VCL and probably also the interfaces
    Difficulty: high
  
  Frames (= forms as childs)
    State: not implemented
    Skills: deep knowledge of LCL, VCL, interfaces and IDE
    Difficulty: high

  TControl.Font
    State: not implemented. In contrary to the VCL the LCL should use the
           current Theme of the user. So, the Font property should only work,
           if explicitly set
    Skills: knowledge of LCL, gtk, win32
    Difficulty: medium

  TToolBar
    State: needs redesign. The current design is too win32 specific.
           It should delegate at least half the work to the interfaces, which
           should create the interface specific toolbar and buttons.
    Skills: LCL, gtk, little win32

1.3 gtk interface

  FileDialog
    State: Filter does not work
    Skills: gtk
    Difficulty: medium
    
  Special keys - for example Ctrl-Shift-1
    State: not implemented
    Skills: gtk, X
    Difficulty: medium

  Graphics

           windowmanagers and limitations of gtk1

  Doublebuffering

  Paint Messages with clipping area
    State: At the moment paint messages are collected and only sent after all
           other messages. This reduces flickering in general. But the paint
           messages dont reduce the clipping area and so all TControls without
           handle redraws everytime.
    Skills: deep knowledge of LCL, gtk-interface and gtk
    Difficulty: high

         Needs debugging
  Skills: Knowledge of LCL, win32 api
  Difficulty: medium
