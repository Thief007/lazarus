Installation hints for lazarus
==============================

Lazarus provides two main parts:
- LCL - the Lazarus Component Library
- IDE - the RAD tool

What is required for lazarus:
- FreePascal - the FreePascal Compiler plus packages plus sources.
- gtk - Most distributions already install them. See www.gtk.org.


The FAQ - Frequently Asked Question is available at www.lazarus.freepascal.org
  and some can be found in FAQ.


The following will describe how to get FreePascal and how to install lazarus
properly:


1. Installing FreePascal

1.1 Installing FreePascal under Linux:
  Lazarus requires a fpc (FreePascal) version not older than 21th september 2002
  and it requires both - the compiled fpc libs (binaries) and the fpc sources.

  The fpc binaries:
  At the lazarus downloads section (www.lazarus.freepascal.org) you can get the
  rpm of the freepascal compiler (compiler / linux) and its packages without the
  sources. Or if you don't have a rpm system, you can download and install the
  tars from the same place.

  The fpc sources:
  The easiest way to get the freepascal sources is via cvs. But cvs requires an
  internet connection. If you want to download it as whole, see
  http://www.freepascal.org/develop.html
  for the daily snapshot of the release tree (1.0.x).

  The fpc sources via cvs:
  Create a directory, where you would like to put the sources. You don't need
  to be root to do this. Any normal user can do:
  
  []$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:cvs@cvs.freepascal.org:/FPC/CVS
  []$ cvs login

  password is 'cvs' without the ''

  []$ cvs -z3 co -r FIXES_1_0_0 fpc
  
  This will create a directory fpc, which can be later used in the IDE.

2. Installing Lazarus

2.1 Installing Lazarus under Linux:
  Currently there are no rpms for lazarus, but hopefully there will be rpms and
  debs in a week. Because the whole lazarus stuff is installed into one
  directory, uninstall is very easy and you don't need to be root to install
  lazarus.
  You can get zip files from the downloads section or you can download it
  directly via cvs.
  
  ToDo: more details about the tars.
  
  You can download lazarus by cvs. cvs provides an easy way to update your
  sources by only downloading the changes. This is the recommended way and saves
  you a lot of time. A connection to the internet is needed for this:
  You don't to be root. Lazarus does not need any special permissions, not
  during installation nor at runtime.
  First create a directory for lazarus (e.g. /home/username/freepascal) then do
  the following:
  
  connect to the cvs server (note: lazarus and freepascal use the same server)
  
  []$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:cvs@cvs.freepascal.org:/FPC/CVS
  []$ cvs login

  password is 'cvs' without the ''

  download the lazarus sources:

  []$ cvs -z3 co lazarus

  compile lazarus:

  []$ cd lazarus
  []$ make

  If fpc is installed correct, the compilation should work without problems. If
  not, see FAQ.
  start lazarus

  []$ ./lazarus

  The IDE should start. If you started lazarus in a terminal, you can see some
  notes about missing settings. This is normal at first start.
  The IDE automatically tries to find out where the freepascal compiler and its
  sources are installed by searching in the most common directories.
  Check the paths:
    Use the IDE menu to go to
      Environment -> Environment Options -> Files

    The 'FPC Source directory' should point to your fpc source directory. This
    directory normally ends with /fpc/ or /fpcsrc/ (e.g. /usr/src/fpcsrc,
    /home/username/freepascal/fpc) and
    contains directories like 'compiler', 'docs', 'fcl', 'rtl' and 'packages'.

    ToDo: explain the other paths


2.1 Installing Lazarus under Windows:

  Under windows the IDE does not run well. So don't expect too much.

  Thx to Joe for this Step-by-step description:

  You have to download the lazarus source:
  ftp://ftp.freepascal.org/pub/fpc/source/lazarus.zip

  Then unzip it to c:\lazarus for example.
  You have to install at least fpc1.0.6. It compiles to me and lazarus.exe
  works. The path to my fpc is: c:\pp\bin\win32. In this directory you
  can find a lot of exe (make, grep, ppc386, and so on).

  Open a command line. Start->Run...>command or choose MS-DOS icon.
  Type:
  cd c:\lazarus
  set path=c:\pp\bin\win32;c:\lazarus  //of course change the first to
                                       //the path of yours
  windres -i lazarus.rc -o lazarus.res
  make

  If you are lucky then you can type: lazarus.exe
  At this moment I do not suggest to try source editor (if you compiled
  with 1.0.6 on win98se). Maybe you have to reboot. Dialogs work and the
  property editor but... Look and you will see.
  (With fpc1.0.7 no hangs.)

  You can compile examples also:
  cd examples
  make

  If you extracted lazarus to another drive, eg.: d:\lazarus. It can happen
  that you need the gnu utility to make it. If you have it, you can take its
  path to set path=...;<gmakepath> but it is simpler not to choose drive d:\

  That's all.
