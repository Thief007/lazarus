  { TProgressEvent is a generic progress notification event which may be
        used by TGraphic classes with computationally intensive (slow)
        operations, such as loading, storing, or transforming image data.
    Event params:
      Stage - Indicates whether this call to the OnProgress event is to
        prepare for, process, or clean up after a graphic operation.  If
        OnProgress is called at all, the first call for a graphic operation
        will be with Stage = psStarting, to allow the OnProgress event handler
        to allocate whatever resources it needs to process subsequent progress
        notifications.  After Stage = psStarting, you are guaranteed that
        OnProgress will be called again with Stage = psEnding to allow you
        to free those resources, even if the graphic operation is aborted by
        an exception.  Zero or more calls to OnProgress with Stage = psRunning
        may occur between the psStarting and psEnding calls.
      PercentDone - The ratio of work done to work remaining, on a scale of
        0 to 100.  Values may repeat or even regress (get smaller) in
        successive calls.  PercentDone is usually only a guess, and the
        guess may be dramatically altered as new information is discovered
        in decoding the image.
      RedrawNow - Indicates whether the graphic can be/should be redrawn
        immediately.  Useful for showing successive approximations of
        an image as data is available instead of waiting for all the data
        to arrive before drawing anything.  Since there is no message loop
        activity during graphic operations, you should call Update to force
        a control to be redrawn immediately in the OnProgress event handler.
        Redrawing a graphic when RedrawNow = False could corrupt the image
        and/or cause exceptions.
      Rect - Area of image that has changed and needs to be redrawn.
      Msg - Optional text describing in one or two words what the graphic
        class is currently working on.  Ex:  "Loading" "Storing"
        "Reducing colors".  The Msg string can also be empty.
        Msg strings should be resourced for translation,  should not
        contain trailing periods, and should be used only for
        display purposes.  (do not: if Msg = 'Loading' then...)

  new constants for compatibility

  Revision 1.7  2002/09/27 20:52:21  lazarus
  MWE: Applied patch from "Andrew Johnson" <aj_genius@hotmail.com>

  Here is the run down of what it includes -

   -Vasily Volchenko's Updated Russian Localizations

   -improvements to GTK Styles/SysColors
   -initial GTK Palette code - (untested, and for now useless)

   -Hint Windows and Modal dialogs now try to stay transient to
    the main program form, aka they stay on top of the main form
    and usually minimize/maximize with it.

   -fixes to Form BorderStyle code(tool windows needed a border)

   -fixes DrawFrameControl DFCS_BUTTONPUSH to match Win32 better
    when flat

   -fixes DrawFrameControl DFCS_BUTTONCHECK to match Win32 better
    and to match GTK theme better. It works most of the time now,
    but some themes, noteably Default, don't work.

   -fixes bug in Bitmap code which broke compiling in NoGDKPixbuf
    mode.

   -misc other cleanups/ fixes in gtk interface

   -speedbutton's should now draw correctly when flat in Win32

   -I have included an experimental new CheckBox(disabled by
    default) which has initial support for cbGrayed(Tri-State),
    and WordWrap, and misc other improvements. It is not done, it
    is mostly a quick hack to test DrawFrameControl
    DFCS_BUTTONCHECK, however it offers many improvements which
    can be seen in cbsCheck/cbsCrissCross (aka non-themed) state.

   -fixes Message Dialogs to more accurately determine
    button Spacing/Size, and Label Spacing/Size based on current
    System font.
   -fixes MessageDlgPos, & ShowMessagePos in Dialogs
   -adds InputQuery & InputBox to Dialogs

   -re-arranges & somewhat re-designs Control Tabbing, it now
    partially works - wrapping around doesn't work, and
    subcontrols(Panels & Children, etc) don't work. TabOrder now
    works to an extent. I am not sure what is wrong with my code,
    based on my other tests at least wrapping and TabOrder SHOULD
    work properly, but.. Anyone want to try and fix?

   -SynEdit(Code Editor) now changes mouse cursor to match
    position(aka over scrollbar/gutter vs over text edit)

   -adds a TRegion property to Graphics.pp, and Canvas. Once I
    figure out how to handle complex regions(aka polygons) data
    properly I will add Region functions to the canvas itself
    (SetClipRect, intersectClipRect etc.)

   -BitBtn now has a Stored flag on Glyph so it doesn't store to
    lfm/lrs if Glyph is Empty, or if Glyph is not bkCustom(aka
    bkOk, bkCancel, etc.) This should fix most crashes with older
    GDKPixbuf libs.
